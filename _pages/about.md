My research focuses on the intersection of human-centered AI and behavioral economics. I combine machine learning with laboratory and field experiments (e.g., A/B testing) and large-scale data analysis to study how LLM-based systems shape fairness, efficiency, and human attention in domains such as science, hiring, the job market, and crowdfunding. Ultimately, I aim to understand the broader implications of human-AI collaboration and to design LLM agents that improve social outcomes.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Information Science at the University of Michigan, advised by [Prof. Qiaozhu Mei](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/qiaozhu-mei) and [Prof. Yan Chen](https://yanchen.people.si.umich.edu/). I hold a B.Econ. from Duke Kunshan University and a B.A. from Duke University.
